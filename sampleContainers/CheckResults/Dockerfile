# Now, we get the validation program in some way (copying, git clone, etc...)
# which should also write the results in the canonical format expected by the
# community metrics docker instances.
# It takes two parameters: results file/directory, output file/directory
# The return value tells whether the validation and the translation to
# the canonical format whether worked or failed
