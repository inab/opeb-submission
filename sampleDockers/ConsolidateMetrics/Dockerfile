# installs the two packages it needs

# Now, we get the metrics computation program in some way (copying, git clone, etc...)
# which should also write its output in a single JSON file.
# It takes three parameters: input directory with all the JSON metrics, directory with
# all the needed reference databases, and the output consolidated JSON file
# The return value tells whether the metrics consolidation whether
# worked or failed
